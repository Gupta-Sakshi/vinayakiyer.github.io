I am a 5th year PhD Student in the Department of Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. <br/> <br/>
My primary research fields are <b>Labor, Education, and Development</b>.  My research spans both developed and developing countries, and is mainly focused on women's labor supply constraints and labor productivity, determinants of educational outcomes and achievement gaps, and Crime.

Before joining UT, I completed my Masters in Economics from Delhi School of Economics, India.
