I am a 4th year PhD Candidate in the Department of Economics at University of Texas at Austin. <br/> <br/>
My primary research fields are Labor, Development, and Public Economics. I am particularly interested in questions focusing on Education, Gender, and Health. 

Before joining UT, I completed my Masters in Economics from Delhi School of Economics, India.
