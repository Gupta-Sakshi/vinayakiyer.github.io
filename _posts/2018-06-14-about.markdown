<p style="color:#000000;">I am a 5th year PhD Student in the Department of Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. My research fields are Labor, Education, and Development.  I am primarily interested in questions related to women's labor supply, education policies, and determinants of achievement gaps among students.
<br> My current work focuses on understanding the impact of exclusionary school policies and placement in alternative schools on short-run as well as long-run outcomes of students.</p>

<p style="color:#000000;">Before joining UT, I was working as a Lecturer at the University of Delhi, where I taught full-semster courses in <emph>Intermediate Microeconomics</emph> and <emph>Development Economics</emph> to undergraduates in Economics. </p>
