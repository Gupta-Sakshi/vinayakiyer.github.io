<p style="color:#000000;">I am a 5th year PhD Student in the Department of Economics at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<br></p>My research fields are Labor, Education, and Development.  I am primarily interested in questions related to women's labor supply, education policies, and determinants of achievement gaps among students. My current work focuses on understanding the impact of exclusionary discipline policies and disciplinary alternative schools on short-run as well as long-run outcomes of students.</p>

<p style="color:#000000;">Before joining UT, I was working as a Lecturer at the University of Delhi, where I taught full-semster courses in <emph>Intermediate Microeconomics</emph> and <emph>Development Economics</emph> to undergraduates in Economics. </p>
