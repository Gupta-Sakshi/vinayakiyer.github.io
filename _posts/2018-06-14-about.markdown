I am an Assistant Professor at the Business School of Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM).

I am primarily a macroeconomist who works in international macroeconomics, monetary economics and emerging market business cycles.

Before joining ITAM, I finished my PhD in economics from Columbia University.

Apart from doing research, I like running marathons and travel photography.
