<p style="color:#000000;">I am a 5th year PhD Student in the Department of Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. My primary research fields are Labor, Education, and Development.  I am primarily interested in questions related to women's labor supply; determinants of achievement gaps and impact of different education policies. 
<br> My current work focuses on understanding the impacts of exclusionary disciplinary policies in Texas.</p>

<p style="color:#000000;">Before joining UT, I was working as a Lecturer at the University of Delhi, where I taught full-semster courses in <emph>Intermediate Microeconomics</emph> and <emph>Development Economics</emph> to undergraduates in Economics. </p>
