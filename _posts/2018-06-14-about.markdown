I am a 4th year PhD Candidate in the Department of Economics at Columbia University. My primary research interests are in the fields of Urban Economics, Industrial Organization and Applied Micro

Before joining Columbia, I completed my Masters from Delhi School of Economics.

Apart from research, I like playing chess and squash.
