<p><font color="#000000"> Hello! I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at University of Texas at Austin. My research interest is in Labor and Development Economics, with a specific focus on Education and Female Labor Supply. My current work focuses on understanding the impact of exclusionary school discipline and peer interactions at disciplinary alternative schools on short-run and long-run outcomes of students.

I am on the job market this year and will be available for interviews at the ASSA 2022 Virtual Annual Meeting on January 7-9, 2022.
