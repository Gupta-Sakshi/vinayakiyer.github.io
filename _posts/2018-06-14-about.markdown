I am a 5th year PhD Student in the Department of Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. <br/> <br/>
My primary research fields are <strong>Labor and Education</strong>.  My research spans both developed and developing countries, and is mainly focused on questions related to women's labor supply constraints, labor productivity; determinants of educational outcomes and achievement gaps, and impact of educational policies on individuals' educational as well as labor market outcomes. 

Before joining UT, I was working as a full-time Instructor at the University of Delhi, where I taught full courses in <emph>Intermediate Microeconomics</emph> and <emph>Development Economics</emph> to undergraduates in Economics.
