<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">Women are known to bear the largest share of health, time and labor supply burden associated with a lack of modern energy. In this paper, we study the impact of clean energy access on adult health and labor supply outcomes by exploiting a nationwide rollout of clean cooking fuel program in Indonesia. This program led to a large-scale fuel switching, from kerosene, a dirty fuel, to liquid petroleum gas, a significantly cleaner and efficient cooking fuel than kerosene. Using rich longitudinal survey data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey and the staggered structure of the program roll-out, we find that access to clean cooking led to a significant improvement in women's health, particularly among those who spend most of their time indoors doing housework. We also find an increase in the labor supplied by these women suggesting that having clean and efficient cooking fuel may not only improved women's health but also improve their productivity, subsequently allowing them to supply more market labor. For men, we find an increase in the hours of labor supplied, with a higher increase among men in households where women accrued the largest health and labor benefits from the program. These results highlight the role of clean energy in reducing gender-disparity in health and labor participation and point to the existence of positive externality from improved health and productivity of women on other members of the household.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper studies the labor supply response of women to changes in expected alimony. Using an alimony law change in the US that significantly reduced the post-divorce alimony support among women, I first show that this led to an increase in divorce probability. Second, consistent with the theoretical prediction from a simple model of labor supply, the reform led to an increase in the female labor force participation, with a larger increase among ever-married and more educated samples of women. As a result, the average female wage income increased after the reform. However, while labor supply increased, I show that most of this increase was concentrated in part-time employment, which may not be sufficient to compensate for the expected loss in alimony income. I estimate a net loss of $40,621 in PDV of lifetime income due to the reform. In light of the recent movement in the US to reform alimony laws, these findings are pertinent to understand its implications on women's labor supply and economic well-being.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper studies the labor supply response of women to changes in expected alimony. I exploit the Massachusetts’ Alimony Reform Act of 2011 which significantly reduced post-divorce alimony support, primarily among women. Consistent with theoretical predictions from a simple model oflabor supply in the presence of divorce and alimony payments, I show that the reform led to —a) an increase in separation probabilities, b) an increase in female labor force participation, and c)an increase in average female wage-income after the reform.  While women increased their labor participation in response to the reform, most of this increase occurred in low-paid part-time jobs, which may not be sufficient to compensate for the lost alimony income.  A back of the envelope calculation suggests a net reduction in the expected lifetime income of women due to the reform. These findings are pertinent in understanding the implications of the recent movement in the US for elimination of the lifetime alimony provision.</font></p></details></ul>-->

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper analyses the role of technology in reducing heat-induced labor productivity losses. For this, we use a field experiment in India which randomized the use of <em>productivity-augmenting</em> digital mode versus classic paper-and-pen mode for conducting 2000 household surveys. Combining this experimentally induced variation in survey mode with day-to-day variation in temperature, we estimate the impact of survey mode on surveyor productivity as temperature rises. We find that as temperature rises and working conditions start to deteriorate, using digital-mode results in 5 percent higher surveyor-productivity compared to paper surveys. These relative productivity gains are mainly concentrated on extremely hot days - where the adverse impact of heat is likely at its peak. We show that these impacts are not driven by differences in characteristcis of surveyor or respondents, thereby pointing to the role of technology in reducing the adverse effects of heat.</font></p></details></ul>
