<details><summary>Abstract:</summary><p><font size="2">Evidence suggests that firms in poor countries stagnate because they cannot access
growth-conducive markets. We hypothesize that overlooked heterogeneity in marketing
ability distorts market access. To investigate, we gave a random subset of Liberian
firms vouchers for a week-long program that teaches how to sell to corporations, governments,
and other large buyers. Firms that participate win about three times as
many contracts, but only firms with access to the Internet benefit. We use a simple
model and variation in online and offline demand to show evidence that this is because
ICT dampens traditional information frictions, but not marketing barriers.</font></p></details>
