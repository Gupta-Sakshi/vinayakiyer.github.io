  <details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">Evidence suggests that exclusionary discipline such as temporary removals to disciplinary alternative schools has an adverse impact on students' long-run outcomes. This paper examines the role of disruptive peer effects at disciplinary alternative schools in impacting the future removal, educational attainment, and labor market outcomes of students placed at these schools. To study this, we use the restricted administrative records of all high-school students in Texas with a disciplinary placement between 2004 to 2018. Using the fact that a large number of regular schools feed disruptive students into a single disciplinary alternative school, we exploit the over-time variation in peer composition within a disciplinary school to estimate the causal effects of peers' disruptiveness on students’ outcomes. Our results show that having a peer group with higher average disruptiveness at the disciplinary school leads to 1) an increase in students' subsequent disciplinary removals 2) decline in their educational attainment (lower high-school graduation, college enrollment, and college graduation), and 3) decline in their adult employment and earnings (~ 8\% or 1272 USD decline in annual earnings at age 27). These results highlight the need to examine exclusionary discipline policies and adopt approaches that can mitigate the adverse effects of peers at disciplinary schools.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">Women bear a disproportionate share of health and time burden associated with lack of access to modern energy. In this paper, we study the impact of clean energy access on adult health and labor supply outcomes by exploiting a nationwide rollout of clean cooking fuel program in Indonesia. This program led to a large-scale fuel switching, from kerosene, a dirty fuel, to liquid petroleum gas, a cleaner one. Using longitudinal survey data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey and exploiting the staggered structure of the program rollout, we find that access to clean cooking fuel led to a significant improvement in women's health, particularly among those who spend most of their time indoors doing housework. We also find an increase in women's work hours, suggesting that access to cleaner fuel can improve women's health and plausibly their productivity, allowing them to supply more market labor. For men, we find an increase in the work hours and propensity to have an additional job, mainly in households where women accrued the largest health and labor benefits from the program. These results highlight the role of clean energy in reducing gender disparity in health and point to the existence of positive externalities from the improved health of women on other members of the household.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper studies the labor supply response of women to changes in expected alimony. Using an alimony law change in the US that significantly reduced the post-divorce alimony support among women, I first show that this led to an increase in divorce probability. Second, consistent with the theoretical prediction from a simple model of labor supply, the reform led to an increase in the female labor force participation, with a larger increase among ever-married and more educated samples of women. As a result, the average female wage income increased after the reform. While labor supply increased, I show that most of this increase was concentrated in part-time employment, which may not be sufficient to compensate for the expected loss in alimony income. I estimate a net loss of \$40,621 in PDV of lifetime income due to the reform. In light of the recent movement in the US to reform alimony laws, these findings are pertinent to understand its implications on women's labor supply and economic well-being.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper analyses the role of technology in reducing heat-induced labor productivity losses. For this, we use a field experiment in India which randomized the use of <em>productivity-augmenting</em> digital mode versus classic paper-and-pen mode for conducting 2000 household surveys. Combining this experimentally induced variation in survey mode with day-to-day variation in temperature, we estimate the impact of survey mode on surveyor productivity as temperature rises. We find that as temperature rises and working conditions start to deteriorate, using digital-mode results in 5 percent higher surveyor-productivity compared to paper surveys. These relative productivity gains are mainly concentrated on extremely hot days - where the adverse impact of heat is likely at its peak. We show that these impacts are not driven by differences in characteristcis of surveyor or respondents, thereby pointing to the role of technology in reducing the adverse effects of heat.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper studies the labor supply response of women to changes in expected alimony. I exploit the Massachusetts’ Alimony Reform Act of 2011 which significantly reduced post-divorce alimony support, primarily among women. Consistent with theoretical predictions from a simple model oflabor supply in the presence of divorce and alimony payments, I show that the reform led to —a) an increase in separation probabilities, b) an increase in female labor force participation, and c)an increase in average female wage-income after the reform.  While women increased their labor participation in response to the reform, most of this increase occurred in low-paid part-time jobs, which may not be sufficient to compensate for the lost alimony income.  A back of the envelope calculation suggests a net reduction in the expected lifetime income of women due to the reform. These findings are pertinent in understanding the implications of the recent movement in the US for elimination of the lifetime alimony provision.</font></p></details></ul>-->

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">  In this paper, we analyze the impact of disciplinary removals of high school students from their regular instructional environments on rates of graduation, drop-out, and other exits. We use the administrative records of all students entering 9th grade in Texas public schools between 1999 and 2014, including their referrals to the Disciplinary Alternative Education Programs (DAEPs) which provided educational programming during periods of disciplinary removal. Noting that physical distance to DAEP campuses is an important determinant of a school’s propensity to refer students to DAEPs, we exploit variation in the timing of the entry and exit of local DAEPs across Texas, employing an event-study design to analyze the impact of DAEPs on graduation, drop-out, and other exits. We estimate separately the effect of DAEPs on removed students as well as the indirect effect of attending a high-removal school on students who are not removed.</font></p></details></ul>
