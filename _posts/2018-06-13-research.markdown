<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">Women are known to bear the largest share of health, time and labor supply burden associated with a lack of modern energy. In this paper, we study the impact of clean energy access on adult health and labor supply outcomes by exploiting a nationwide rollout of clean cooking fuel program in Indonesia. This program led to a large-scale fuel switching, from kerosene, a dirty fuel, to liquid petroleum gas, a significantly cleaner and efficient cooking fuel than kerosene. Using rich longitudinal survey data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey and the staggered structure of the program roll-out, we find that access to clean cooking led to a significant improvement in women's health, particularly among those who spend most of their time indoors doing housework. We also find an increase in the labor supplied by these women suggesting that having clean and efficient cooking fuel may not only improved women's health but also improve their productivity, subsequently allowing them to supply more market labor. For men, we find an increase in the hours of labor supplied, with a higher increase among men in households where women accrued the largest health and labor benefits from the program. These results highlight the role of clean energy in reducing gender-disparity in health and labor participation and point to the existence of positive externality from improved health and productivity of women on other members of the household.</font></p></details></ul>

<details><summary><font size="2">Abstract:</font></summary><p><font size="2" style="color:#000000;">This paper studies the labor supply response of women to changes in expected alimony. I exploit the Massachusetts’ Alimony Reform Act of 2011 which significantly reduced post-divorce alimony support, primarily among women. Consistent with theoretical predictions from a simple model oflabor supply in the presence of divorce and alimony payments, I show that the reform led to —a) an increase in separation probabilities, b) an increase in female labor force participation, and c)an increase in average female wage-income after the reform.  While women increased their labor participation in response to the reform, most of this increase occurred in low-paid part-time jobs, which may not be sufficient to compensate for the lost alimony income.  A back of the envelope calculation suggests a net reduction in the expected lifetime income of women due to the reform. These findings are pertinent in understanding the implications of the recent movement in the US for elimination of the lifetime alimony provision.</font></p></details></ul>-->
