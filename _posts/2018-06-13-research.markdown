  <h4><b>Access-to-Demand Frictions and Firm Growth : Experimental Evidence from Liberia</b>, (with Jonas Hjort and Golvine de Rochambeau)

<details><summary>Abstract:</summary><p><font size="2">In order to explain high consumption volatility and the ratio of consumption to output volatility, the key financial friction that has been considered in the literature is the interest rate shock to the economy. This paper builds a quantitative model by including hand to mouth consumers, which along with interest rate shock acts as the second financial friction. With the data from 18 rich, 25 poor and 32 emerging countries, the paper uses Bayesian estimation method to estimate the parameters of the RBC model with and without hand to mouth consumers for each country and looks at the importance of having hand to mouth consumers in the model. The paper finds that having hand-to-mouth consumers in the model increases the ratio of consumption to output volatility. The paper also finds that, on an average, the contribution of non-stationary shocks towards volatility of TFP is 34% for rich countries, 46% for emerging countries, and 50% for poor countries. The results are in contrast with previous research where some predicted TFP growth is driven primarily by non-stationary productivity shocks while others suggested a negligible role of non-stationary productivity shocks.</font></p></details>
